              August 2012 <br /> My World Travel had begun from SouthEastAsia.{" "}
              <br />
              Beautiful natures, but also many troubles like landslides, a
              terrible tour and a motorbike accident.
              <br />
              But thanks to those experiences, I got used to backpacker travel
              life.
